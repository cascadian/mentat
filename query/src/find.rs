///! This module defines some core types that support find expressions: sources,
///! variables, expressions, etc.
///! These are produced as 'fuel' by the query parser, consumed by the query
///! translator and executor.
///!
///! Many of these types are defined as simple structs that are little more than
///! a richer type alias: a variable, for example, is really just a fancy kind
///! of string.
///!
///! At some point in the future, we might consider reducing copying and memory
///! usage by recasting all of these string-holding structs and enums in terms
///! of string references, with those references being slices of some parsed
///! input query string, and valid for the lifetime of that string.
///!
///! For now, for the sake of simplicity, all of these strings are heap-allocated.
///!
///! Furthermore, we might cut out some of the chaff here: each time a 'tagged'
///! type is used within an enum, we have an opportunity to simplify and use the
///! inner type directly in conjunction with matching on the enum. Before diving
///! deeply into this it's worth recognizing that this loss of 'sovereignty' is
///! a tradeoff against well-typed function signatures and other such boundaries.

/// Examples:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use datomish_query::find::{FindSpec, Element, Variable};
///
/// // TODO: this feels clunky.
/// let foo = Variable { name: "foo".to_string() };
/// let bar = Variable { name: "bar".to_string() };
/// let elements = vec![
///   Element::Variable { variable: foo },
///   Element::Variable { variable: bar },
/// ];
/// let rel = FindSpec::FindRel { elements: elements };

/// if let FindSpec::FindRel { elements } = rel {
///   assert_eq!(2, elements.len());
